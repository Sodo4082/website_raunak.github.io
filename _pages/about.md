👨🏻‍💻 I'm an BS-MS student in Mathematics Major and Data Science Minor from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali, India.

👨🏻‍🔬 I am currently situated at IIT Delhi to write my final year masters thesis.

🔬 I am interested in understanding the working behind machine learning models and get pretty excited seeing application of pure math topics in ML and AI.

📚 My masters project is in statFEM, a workflow to accomodate for model misspecification.
